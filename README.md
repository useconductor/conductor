# Conductor

> Your AI integration hub — 27 plugins, 150+ tools, one installer. Now with Slack, Telegram, Proactive Mode, and Persona Routing.

Conductor is a TypeScript-based AI engine that bridges the gap between LLMs (Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Ollama, OpenRouter) and your digital workflow. It exposes a massive library of tools—including Gmail, Spotify, GitHub, and Slack—as an **MCP server**, **Telegram bot**, or **Slack bot**.

---

## What is Conductor?

Conductor sits between you and your AI model. You send a natural language request; Conductor figures out which tools to use, chains multiple calls together, and returns a result.

**Example flow:**

```
You: "Check my unread Gmail, add any urgent items to my calendar, then notify me on Slack."

Conductor:
  1. determinePersona() → "general"
  2. gmail_list() → 3 unread emails
  3. AI identifies 1 urgent item
  4. gcal_create_event() → event created
  5. Slack message sent → "Done: 1 event added from email."
```

Conductor works the same way whether you talk to it through a Slack message, a Telegram bot, or the Claude Desktop app via MCP.

---

## What's New

- **Proactive Mode** — Autonomous reasoning loop that monitors your system and services every N minutes and acts without prompting.
- **Persona Routing** — AI-driven request classification routes to the right tool set (Coder, Social, Researcher, General).
- **Slack Integration** — Deploy Conductor as a Slack bot to bring AI tool-calling to your workspace.
- **Enhanced Google OAuth** — Streamlined authentication flow shared across Gemini, Gmail, Calendar, and Drive.
- **Advanced Tool Calling** — Improved logic for AI-driven multi-step execution.
- **Hardened Security** — AES-256-GCM keychain encryption tied to hardware IDs.

## Install

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://conductor.thealxlabs.ca/install.sh | bash

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
irm https://conductor.thealxlabs.ca/install.ps1 | iex
```

The 14-step interactive installer configures AI providers, Google OAuth, Slack/Telegram tokens, and Claude Desktop MCP. Every step is optional and skippable.

**Requirements:**
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm

The installer checks for Node.js automatically and guides you through setup. It is fully idempotent — re-running it is safe.

## Quick Start

```bash
conductor status              # Check setup and plugin health
conductor slack start         # Launch the Slack bot
conductor telegram start      # Launch the Telegram bot
conductor mcp setup           # Auto-configure Claude Desktop
conductor ai switch gemini    # Swap your primary AI model
conductor proactive start     # Start autonomous mode (every 30 min)
```

---

## Architecture

Conductor is built around four core components:

### 1. Core (`src/core/`)

- **`Conductor`** — The central orchestrator. Initializes configuration, the database, plugins, and AI on startup. Owns the proactive reasoning loop and notification dispatch.
- **`ConfigManager`** — Reads and writes `~/.conductor/config.json`. Supports dot-path key access (e.g., `plugins.enabled`). Config writes are atomic (write to `.tmp`, then rename).
- **`DatabaseManager`** — SQLite database via `sql.js`. Stores conversation history, plugin registry, activity logs, and credentials metadata.

### 2. AI Layer (`src/ai/`)

- **`AIManager`** — Loads the configured provider, runs the agent loop, and manages Persona Routing. The `handleConversation()` method drives up to 15 tool-calling iterations per request before halting.
- Provider implementations: `ClaudeProvider`, `OpenAIProvider`, `GeminiProvider`, `OllamaProvider`, `OpenRouterProvider` — each implements a common `AIProvider` interface with `complete()`, `test()`, and `parseIntent()`.

### 3. Plugin System (`src/plugins/`)

- **`PluginManager`** — Loads all builtin plugins at startup, checks `config.json` for which are enabled, and exposes `getEnabledTools()` to the AI layer.
- Each plugin exports a `Plugin` object with a name, description, and array of `PluginTool` entries. Tools declare an `inputSchema` (JSON Schema) and an async `execute()` / `handler()` function.
- Tools can declare `requiresApproval: true` — when an AI tries to call such a tool, execution pauses and the user is notified for manual approval via Slack or Telegram.

### 4. Interfaces

- **MCP Server** (`src/mcp/`) — Implements the Model Context Protocol so Conductor's tools appear natively in Claude Desktop. Runs in stdio mode.
- **Slack Bot** (`src/bot/slack.ts`) — Uses `@slack/bolt`. Listens for `@conductor` mentions and DMs.
- **Telegram Bot** (`src/bot/telegram.ts`) — Uses `telegraf`. Handles `/start`, `/approve`, `/deny`, and conversational messages.

### Agent Loop

Each conversation turn runs a loop (max 15 iterations):

```
1. User message → stored in SQLite conversation history
2. Persona detection → classifies request into coder / social / researcher / general
3. System prompt set → per-persona instructions injected
4. AI provider called with full history + available tools
5. If tool calls returned → execute each tool, append results
6. If requiresApproval tool → pause loop, notify user
7. Repeat from step 4 until AI returns a plain text response
8. Final response returned to the user interface
```

Conductor keeps the last 30 messages of conversation history per user for context.

## Lumen AI API

Conductor exposes your local **Lumen/Ollama** instance as an authenticated HTTP endpoint. This lets scripts, CI pipelines, or other machines on your network forward coding tasks to your machine's AI — without giving them shell access.

### How it works

```
Remote client
     │  POST /api/lumen/ask
     │  Authorization: Bearer cnd_...
     ▼
Conductor (port 4242, your machine)
     │  validates API key
     ▼
Ollama (localhost:11434) → Lumen model
     │  runs shell / reads files / writes code
     ▼
JSON result back to caller
```

### Generate an API key

Open the Conductor dashboard (`conductor status` → follow the link) and click **Generate Lumen API Key**, or use `curl`:

```bash
# Generate a key (run this on your local machine)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4242/api/lumen/key | jq -r .key
# → cnd_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

Save this key. It is shown only once. Store it wherever you call the API from (e.g. a GitHub Actions secret, a `.env` file, etc.).

### Call Lumen remotely

```bash
# From any machine that can reach your Conductor server
curl -s -X POST http://YOUR-IP:4242/api/lumen/ask \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer cnd_a1b2c3d4e5f6..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": "check git status and show changed files"}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "result": "On branch main, 2 files changed: src/index.ts, package.json",
  "iterations": 3,
  "toolCalls": ["run_shell({\"command\":\"git status\"})"]
}
```

**Request body:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `task` | string | yes | Natural language task for Lumen to complete |
| `max_iterations` | number | no | Agentic loop limit (default: 10) |

### Manage your API key

```bash
# Check if a key exists
curl http://localhost:4242/api/lumen/key/status

# Revoke the current key
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4242/api/lumen/key
```

### Security notes

- The API key is encrypted in `~/.conductor/keychain/` using AES-256-GCM (same as all other credentials).
- The key is compared using a timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks.
- Lumen runs **on your machine** with full shell and filesystem access — treat your API key like a root password.
- Conductor's dashboard server (`port 4242`) only binds to `localhost` by default. To expose it to the network, run it behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) with HTTPS.

---

## Proactive Mode

Proactive Mode starts an autonomous reasoning loop that runs every N minutes without any user prompts.

```bash
conductor proactive start              # Run every 30 minutes (default)
conductor proactive start --interval 10  # Run every 10 minutes
```

**What happens each cycle:**

1. **Context gathering** — Conductor collects system stats (CPU, RAM, disk), recent activity, unread Gmail count, and upcoming calendar events.
2. **AI reasoning** — The context is sent to your AI provider with instructions to identify problems and take action.
3. **Approval gate** — Sensitive actions can be held for human approval before execution.
4. **Notification** — Results are sent to you via Slack or Telegram.
5. **Activity logging** — All cycle results are saved to the database.

**Example:** Proactive Mode might notice your disk is 90% full, archive old logs automatically, and send you a Slack message summarizing what it did.

---

## Persona Routing

When you send a message, Conductor classifies it into one of four personas before selecting tools:

| Persona | Triggers | Tool Focus |
|---|---|---|
| **Coder** | Code writing, debugging, git, bash, file management | github_actions, vercel, system, hash, text-tools |
| **Social** | Posting tweets, Slack/Telegram messages, email replies | x, slack, telegram, gmail |
| **Researcher** | Web search, page reading, summarization | weather, translate, url-tools, network |
| **General** | Calendar, emails, small talk, everything else | gcal, gmail, memory, notes, cron |

Routing happens automatically. You don't need to specify a persona — Conductor infers it from your message using a fast AI classification call before the main conversation loop begins.

---

## Approval Gates

Tools can require human approval before execution. When an AI attempts to use an approval-gated tool:

1. The agent loop pauses immediately.
2. A notification is sent to you via Slack or Telegram with the tool name and arguments.
3. You reply with `/approve <tool_call_id>` to allow it, or `/deny <tool_call_id>` to block it.
4. Conductor resumes the conversation loop with the result.

This is especially useful for Proactive Mode, where the AI acts autonomously — approval gates ensure destructive or irreversible actions always go through you first.

## Configuration

All configuration lives in `~/.conductor/`:

```
~/.conductor/
├── config.json          # Main config (AI provider, enabled plugins, settings)
├── conductor.db         # SQLite database (conversation history, memory, activity logs)
├── keychain/            # AES-256-GCM encrypted credentials
├── notes/               # Markdown notes (notes plugin)
├── scheduler.json       # Scheduled cron tasks
└── logs/                # Activity logs
```

**Key management commands:**

```bash
conductor auth google           # Add Google credentials (Gmail, Calendar, Drive)
conductor ai setup              # Add AI provider API keys
conductor plugins enable slack  # Enable Slack (will prompt for tokens)
```

No raw secrets are stored in `config.json`. All credentials are encrypted in `~/.conductor/keychain/` using AES-256-GCM with a key derived from your machine's hardware ID.

### `config.json` structure

```json
{
  "user": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "role": "..." },
  "ai": {
    "provider": "claude",
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
  },
  "plugins": {
    "installed": ["gmail", "spotify", "github"],
    "enabled": ["gmail", "spotify"]
  },
  "security": {
    "filesystem_access": { "enabled": false, "allowed_paths": [] },
    "system_commands": false,
    "desktop_control": false
  }
}
```

---

## Security

Credentials are encrypted using **AES-256-GCM**. The master key is derived via `scrypt` from your machine's hardware ID, ensuring secrets only decrypt on the machine that created them.

- **Keychain location**: `~/.conductor/keychain/`
- **Permissions**: `0700`
- **No raw secrets** stored in `config.json`
- **Approval gates** for sensitive proactive actions (configurable)

Report vulnerabilities privately via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/thealxlabs/conductor/security/advisories/new) — do not open a public issue.

## Development

**Requirements:** Node.js >= 18, TypeScript 5.x

```bash
npm run dev    # Start in watch mode (tsx watch)
npm run build  # Transpile TypeScript to dist/
npm start      # Run production build
npm test       # Run all tests (skips auth-required plugins)
npm run test:full  # Run all tests including auth plugins
```

### Adding a Plugin

Implement the `Plugin` interface in `src/plugins/builtin/` and register it in `src/plugins/builtin/index.ts`. It will automatically appear across all interfaces (MCP, Slack, Telegram).

```typescript
import { Plugin, PluginTool, ToolResult } from '../types';

export const myPlugin: Plugin = {
  name: 'my-plugin',
  description: 'What this plugin does',
  tools: [
    {
      name: 'my_tool',
      description: 'What this tool does',
      inputSchema: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          query: { type: 'string', description: 'Input value' },
        },
        required: ['query'],
      },
      execute: async (args: { query: string }): Promise<ToolResult> => {
        // your logic here
        return { success: true, data: `Result for: ${args.query}` };
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

Then add it to `src/plugins/builtin/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { myPlugin } from './my-plugin';

export const builtinPlugins: Plugin[] = [
  // ... existing plugins
  myPlugin,
];
```

Your plugin will be available via `conductor plugins enable my-plugin` and will show up in all interfaces.
